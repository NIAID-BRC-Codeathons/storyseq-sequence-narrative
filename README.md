# StorySeq: Automated Sequence Narrative Generation

Automating sequence identification and contextualization using BLAST, database queries, and LLM narrative synthesis to accelerate pathogen and AMR gene discovery

## About This Project

This is a project from the **NIAID BRC AI Codeathon 2025**, taking place November 12-14, 2025 at Argonne National Laboratory.
